# 🩺 Breast Cancer Classification and Prediction Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality among women worldwide. Early diagnosis is crucial to improve survival rates and treatment effectiveness.  
This project develops a **machine learning–based system** to classify breast tumors as **benign** or **malignant**, using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset**.  

Key highlights:  
- 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  
- 📉 Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, MDS).  
- 🤖 Models: **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Random Forest**.  
- ⚙️ Hyperparameter tuning with **Grid Search** and **Cross-validation**.  
- 📊 Evaluation with **ROC-AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix**.
